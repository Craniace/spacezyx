# Sapcezyx Project

## Overview
This project contains a simple HTML file named `index.html` that serves as the main entry point for the NASA-themed application. The application utilizes modern JavaScript features for handling API calls and data storage.

## Functionality
- **API Calls**: The project makes asynchronous API calls using the `async/await` syntax, providing a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Local Storage**: The application leverages local storage to save data retrieved from API calls, allowing for persistent data access even after page refreshes.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the webpage.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `img/`: Directory containing images used in the project.

## Usage
To view the webpage, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
